## 8 Puzzle Solver

Project done for an upper-level CSC course. Contains a Board and Solver class. This was made using [the algs4 library](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/).

This can solve 8 puzzles of arbitrary size, though it will run into performance and memory issues with more complex puzzles.

## Usage
Both Board.java and Solver.java have their own test client methods. They each take in a file name as an argument. The file contains the dimensions of the puzzle board, followed by the board.
